# How to Add AeroSpace.jpg Logo to AeroShare

## Step 1: Place the Logo File
1. **Copy your `AeroSpace.jpg` file** to the aeroshare folder
2. **Make sure it's named exactly** `AeroSpace.jpg` (case-sensitive)
3. **Place it in the same folder** as `index.html`

## Step 2: Verify the Logo is Working
The logo should automatically appear at the top of the AeroShare interface.

## Step 3: If Logo Doesn't Show
If the logo doesn't appear, try these solutions:

### Option A: Check File Name
- Make sure the file is named exactly `AeroSpace.jpg`
- Check for any extra spaces or characters

### Option B: Use Different File Format
- Try renaming it to `AeroSpace.png` or `AeroSpace.gif`
- Update the HTML code to match the new name

### Option C: Check File Location
- The logo file should be in: `C:\Users\pc\aeroshare\AeroSpace.jpg`
- Same folder as the `index.html` file

## Step 4: Customize Logo Size (Optional)
If you want to adjust the logo size, you can modify the CSS in the HTML file:

```css
.logo {
    width: 140px;  /* Change this value */
    height: 140px; /* Change this value */
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Logo not showing?** Check browser console for errors
- **Wrong size?** Adjust the CSS width and height values
- **Wrong position?** The logo is centered at the top of the page

## File Structure Should Look Like:
```
aeroshare/
├── index.html
├── AeroSpace.jpg  ← Your logo file here
├── client/
└── server/
```

The logo will appear as a 140x140 pixel image at the top center of the AeroShare interface.
